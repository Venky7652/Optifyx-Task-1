# Optifyx-Task-1
**Iris flower classification**

# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

## 📁 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a widely used benchmark in the machine learning community. This project involves:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Model Training using:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
- Model Evaluation and Accuracy Comparison


## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn


## 📊 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize the relationships between features
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Train multiple classification models
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Predict on new samples


## 🔍 Dataset

- Source: [Scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)


## ✅ Results

- Achieved high accuracy using SVM and Decision Tree classifiers.
- Visualizations clearly show separation among classes.
- Gained practical experience in model comparison and performance metrics.
